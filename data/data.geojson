        "Name": "CRATERS OF THE MOON NATIONAL MONUMENT",
        "Description": "<p> Craters Of The Moon National Monument protects some 21,618 hectares of volcanic formations and lava flows on the northern edge of the Snake River Plain in south-central Idaho, U.S. A sequence of eruptions in the area from roughly 15,000 to 2,000 years ago resulted from rifting of the surface due to residual heat from the Yellowstone hotspot, thought to have been located under what is now Craters Of The Moon some 10 to 11 million years ago. Repeated lava flows raised the land elevation enough to expose it to prevailing southwesterly winds, helping to keep the area dry. As a result, there is very little vegetation on the lava fields, giving the area the sense of desolation. Upon signing his executive order creating the Monument in 1924, U.S. President Calvin Coolidge succinctly described it: “this area contains many curious and unusual phenomena of great educational value and has a weird and scenic landscape peculiar to itself.” </p>",

According to UNESCO, the parks offer “outstanding scenery,” and are “exceptionally rich in plant and mammal species as well as prairie, forest, and alpine and glacial features.” The parks occupy a unique position in the Western Cordillera of North America, resulting in the evolution of species and ecologies that exist nowhere else in the world. </p>",

With respect to dark skies, the Park is in a virtually unique setting sandwiched between the “Inland Empire” metropolitan area of some 4 million inhabitants near its western edge, and the last pool of natural darkness remaining in Southern California in its eastern extremity. For residents of the greater Los Angeles area – some 18 million people as of 2015 – Joshua Tree National Park is the nearest convenient place to go stargazing under a relatively dark sky. While the western half of the Park is significant impacted by light from Palm Springs and, to a lesser extent, the cities of the nearby Morongo Basin, visitors who make the trek to the Park’s eastern wilderness area are rewarded with some of the darkest night skies left in the region. </p>",

It is situated on the shores of the eponymous Prineville Reservoir, created in 1961 for irrigation and flood control by damming of the Crooked River by the predecessor of the US Bureau of Reclamation. The Reservoir was in turn created by damming the Crooked River upstream from the nearby town of Prineville, flooding what was then a juniper- and sagebrush-filled canyon. The Reservoir runs 29 kilometers along the length of the Crooked River and functions primarily as an irrigation storage water body containing some 190 million cubic meters of water, with secondary objectives of Crooked River flood control and public recreation. The Park is surrounded by a 3,560-hectare property managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, which bounds the state park on all but one side. The water attracts a remarkable diversity of wildlife, and anglers enjoy excellent fishing opportunities on the Reservoir. </p>",
